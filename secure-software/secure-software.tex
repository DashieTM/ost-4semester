\section{Secure Software Principles}
\textcolor{Cyan}{Rather than trying to solve objectives in cyber security, you should have expectations of your software in terms of security.}

\subsection{CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{High}\newline
    Heartbleed, log4j etc\newline
    often not noticeable, concealed
  \item \textcolor{blue}{Medium}\newline
    unclear if it can be exploited
  \item \textcolor{green}{Low}\newline
    typical problems like outdated tls certificate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Low-hanging fruits first}
\textcolor{teal}{Before we go ahead and takle the biggest issues, we can solve a lot of problems by making sure that we do not fail at the basics.}\newline
In other words, first try to solve the easy things.

\subsection{80\%/20\% Problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Secure the weakest link}\newline
  A boomer might not know about phishing attacks, protect said user against doing something dumb!
\item \textcolor{purple}{Practice defense in depth}\newline
  Use multiple security layers, often 1 is not enough
\item \textcolor{purple}{Fail secure}\newline
  In terms of an error, don't just dump all information to some random person, eg. don't leak credit card information if the information is not 100\% correct.
\item \textcolor{purple}{Follow the principle of least privilege}\newline
  Don't give random people access to things they don't need
\item \textcolor{purple}{Compartmentalize}\newline
  Try to categorize tasks, this makes it easier for people to get access to something.
\item \textcolor{purple}{Keep it simple}\newline
  Try to keep it as simpe as possible
\item \textcolor{purple}{Promote privacy}\newline
  Handle privacy of users appropriately
\item \textcolor{purple}{Remember that hiding secrets is hard}
  In other words, security by obscurity is a novel practice and doesn't really work
\item \textcolor{purple}{Be reluctant to trust}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Use your ommunity resources}
\end{itemize}
