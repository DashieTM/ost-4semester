\section{Secure Software Principles}
\textcolor{Cyan}{Rather than trying to solve objectives in cyber security, you should have expectations of your software in terms of security.}

\subsection{CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{High}\newline
    Heartbleed, log4j etc\newline
    often not noticeable, concealed
  \item \textcolor{blue}{Medium}\newline
    unclear if it can be exploited
  \item \textcolor{green}{Low}\newline
    typical problems like outdated tls certificate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Low-hanging fruits first}
\textcolor{teal}{Before we go ahead and tackle the biggest issues, we can solve a lot of problems by making sure that we do not fail at the basics.}\newline
In other words, first try to solve the easy things.

\subsection{80\%/20\% Problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Secure the weakest link}\newline
  A boomer might not know about phishing attacks, protect said user against doing something dumb!
\item \textcolor{purple}{Practice defense in depth}\newline
  Use multiple security layers, often 1 is not enough
\item \textcolor{purple}{Fail secure}\newline
  In terms of an error, don't just dump all information to some random person, eg. don't leak credit card information if the information is not 100\% correct.
\item \textcolor{purple}{Follow the principle of least privilege}\newline
  Don't give random people access to things they don't need
\item \textcolor{purple}{To Compartmentalize}\newline
  Try to categorize tasks, this makes it easier for people to get access to something.
\item \textcolor{purple}{Keep it simple}\newline
  Try to keep it as simple as possible
\item \textcolor{purple}{Promote privacy}\newline
  Handle privacy of users appropriately
\item \textcolor{purple}{Remember that hiding secrets is hard}
  In other words, security by obscurity is a novel practice and doesn't really work
\item \textcolor{purple}{Be reluctant to trust}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Use your community resources}
\end{itemize}

\section{Threat Models \& Mitigations}
\subsection{The 4 Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textcolor{purple}{What are we working on?}\newline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Define scope and context}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Description of requirements and design}
  \end{itemize} 
\item \textcolor{purple}{What can go wrong?}\newline
  Anciticapte potential issues (think like the attacker)
\item \textcolor{purple}{What are we going to do about it?}\newline
  Define mitigations
\item \textcolor{purple}{Did we do a good job?}\newline
  Reflection and confirmation
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Methodology for Threat Risk Modeling}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Identify security objectives with a focus on:}\newline
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \textcolor{black}{sensitive information stored on device}
 \item \textcolor{black}{third party libraries used}
 \item \textcolor{black}{loss of repudation derived from misuse of the application}
 \end{itemize} 
\item \textcolor{purple}{Break down the application features, i.e. decomposition of the application into small feature sets with the goal to identify security impact}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Identification of related threats and vulnerabilities in implementation}
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Process Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Identity Assets}\newline
What do we own and what do we want to protect? Not everything is worth protecting!
\item \textcolor{purple}{Create an architecture overview}\newline
  Simple diagrams which include application, subsystems, trust boundaries and data flow
\item \textcolor{purple}{Decompose the application}\newline
  The structure of your application -> network model, API, etc that can lead to potential vulnerabilities
\item \textcolor{purple}{Identify the threats}\newline
  From the attackers perspective, try to find loopholes etc to attack your application and \emph{document them}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Document the threats}\newline
\item \textcolor{purple}{Rate the threats} \newline
  Rate the threats according to \emph{likelihood, impact damage (reputation, cost), damage of migitation (cost, annoyance or work)}
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Why?}
The reason we do all this is that the following 3 groups have the these benefits: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Developers}\newline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Know potential threats and develop with them in mind}
  \item \textcolor{black}{priorization of threats to proper mitigations can be taken}
  \end{itemize} 
\item \textcolor{purple}{Penetration Testers}\newline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Makes sure penetration testers don't waste time testing things that don't matter to you}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Have a decent idea where to start}
  \end{itemize} 
\item \textcolor{purple}{Management}\newline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Know the risks in their language -> cost}
  \item \textcolor{black}{Don't make stupid decisions against developers etc since they don't understand IT}
  \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{STRIDE}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{purple}{Spoofing}\newline
Using a false identity to gain access to a system.\newline
\textcolor{green}{Mitigation: Authentication} Cookies, Signatures, updates TLS
\item \textcolor{purple}{Tampering}\newline
unauthorized changes/manipulation of data\newline
\textcolor{green}{Mitigation: Integrity} ACLs, Digital Signatures
\item \textcolor{purple}{Repudation}\newline
The ability to deny having performed an attack,\newline
\textcolor{green}{Mitigation: Nonrepudation} Secure logging and auditing, Digital Signatures
\item \textcolor{purple}{Impersonation}\newline
unauthorized revelation of classified(PROPRIETARY) private information.\newline
\textcolor{green}{Mitigation: Confidentiality} Encryption, ACLS
\item \textcolor{purple}{Denial of Service}\newline
Prevent or restrict access to a service by flooding it.\newline
\textcolor{green}{Mitigation: Availability} ACLs, Filtering, Quotas
\item \textcolor{purple}{Elevation of Privilege}\newline
Gaining unauthorized privileges on a system. For example: becoming root as regular user\newline
\textcolor{green}{Mitigation: Authorization} ACLs, Group or role membership, privilege ownership, input validation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attack Tree}
This is a list of attacks that can lead to another. This can help with attacks that are \emph{not obvious}.\newline
\textcolor{puple}{Attack trees are complementary to threat modeling}\newline
\textcolor{red}{Here an example of how they work:}\newline
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{2023_03_02_11_20_47.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{2023_03_02_11_22_00.png}\newline
\textcolor{purple}{Add labels for possible and impossible actions}\newline
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{2023_03_02_11_22_15.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{2023_03_02_11_22_25.png}\newline
\textcolor{purple}{Propagate the labels up so possible things are closer, after that \emph{define used tools for the actoins}}\newline
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{2023_03_02_11_23_15.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{2023_03_02_11_23_34.png}\newline
\textcolor{purple}{Define monetary costs for the attack and \emph{mark the route with least cost and the least tools used}}
